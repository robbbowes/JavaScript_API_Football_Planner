# JavaScript_API_Football_Planner
Agile Mob JavaScript API Project
_______________

Project Brief:
JavaScript Group Project Guidelines

AIMS/PURPOSE:
_______________
To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these
To have the opportunity to try using agile working methods
To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.
To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class, and if you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

SPORTS DASHBOARD
_______________

Sports fans want to be able to view relevant sporting events on a dashboard. With a sport of your choice, use an existing API or create a new API to display information about fixtures, news and travel information for events.

MVP:
Display upcoming events on a map
Display results and ranking of players/teams
Allow users to add events to a favourites list

ROUTE PLANNER
_______________

Visit Scotland are look for ways to encourage people to walk and cycle. Your task is to create an app that allows users to search for cycling and hiking routes, view routes on a map, save routes to a wishlist and mark a route done.

MVP:
Select start and finish locations for their route
Save routes to a wishlist
Mark completed routes as ‘done’

What I/we would like to improve going forward:

App.js is gigantic.  There is a ton of code that could be abstracted away and imported in.

Had we been able to use a framework rather than purely vanilla JS a fair few issues could have been avoided.

CSS styling needs to be improved.  The media queries ensure that it's responsive, however the page with the individual fixtures on could be tidied up a fair bit.
